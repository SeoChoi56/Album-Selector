**Introduction:** 
These learning goals have been combined to bring you the ‘Album Selector’. This one page app contains an index.html, index.js, and style.css that accesses data from a public API. ‘Album Selector’ will allow the user to click on (via event listener) a specific album based on genre, view the album information (Album name, Artist, Tracklist, and Producer/Label), and add the album to cart via an ‘Add to Cart’ button. The ‘Home’, ‘My Cart’, ‘Customer Service’, and ‘About Us’ tabs will be set to alert (‘insert user alert!’) on click.

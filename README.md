**Introduction:**

These learning goals have been combined to bring you the ‘Album Selector’. This one page app contains an index.html, script.js, and style.css that accesses data from a public API. An image file was created for the website tab as well. ‘Album Selector’ will allow the user to click on a 'Randomizer!' submit form in order to randomly generate an album. The page will return the album information (Album name, Artist, and Tracklist). The user will also have the ability to play a youtube video of the randomly generated album. The ‘Home’, ‘Contact Us’, and ‘About Us’ tabs will be set to alert (‘insert user alert!’) on click (via event listener). The 'Home' tab will return you to the homepage, the 'Contact Us' tab will allow you to submit your name, email, and comments to our page, and the 'About Us' tab will provide the user with information on the Design Team.

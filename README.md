**Introduction:**

These learning goals have been combined to bring you the ‘Album Selector’. This one page app contains an index.html, script.js, and style.css that accesses data from a public API. There is an image file for the website tab as well. ‘Album Selector’ will allow the user to click into a box in order to search for an album name or album artist (via event listener). The page will return the album information (Album name, Artist, Tracklist, and Producer/Label) (via fetch request over array iteration). The user will also have the ability to add the album to My Cart with an ‘Add to Cart’ button (via event listener). The ‘Home’, ‘My Cart’, ‘Customer Service’, and ‘About Us’ tabs will be set to alert (‘insert user alert!’) on click (via event listener).
